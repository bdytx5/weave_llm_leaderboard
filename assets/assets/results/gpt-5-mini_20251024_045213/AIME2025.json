So the only possible s is F, which occurs with probability 1/11 (partner = F). Then after removing {F,G}, the remaining 10 letters split into 5 highs (H\u2013L) and 5 lows (A\u2013E); we require no high\u2013high pair, so the highs must match bijectively to the lows: number of matchings = 5! = 120.

For each digit d (1 through 9), it must appear once in each row and once in each block. Thus for each digit d the positions of its three occurrences correspond to a permutation \u03c3_d \u2208 S3 (which block it appears in for each row). So each digit chooses one of the 6 permutations; call the counts of the six permutations a,b,c,d,e,f (summing to 9).\n\n2. For each macro-column (block) j and each row i the number of digits mapped by their permutation to that (row,block) pair must be exactly 3 (since each macro-cell has 3 actual column positions). Translating this gives the linear system (where the six variables correspond to the six elements of S3):\n\na + d = 3\nb + e = 3\nc + f = 3\n\nb + f = 3\na + c = 3\nd + e = 3\n\nc + e = 3\nd + f = 3\na + b = 3\n\nSolving these, all variables are expressed by one parameter t = d:\na = 3 \u2212 t, b = t, c = t, d = t, e = 3 \u2212 t, f = 3 \u2212 t,\nwith t \u2208 {0,1,2,3}.

Once the digits are assigned to macro-cells, inside each macro-cell (row i, block j) there are exactly 3 digits and 3 column positions, giving 3! ways to place them. There are 9 macro-cells, so an extra factor (3!)^9 = 6^9.\n\n5.
