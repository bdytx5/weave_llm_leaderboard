For \u2220A to be acute we need AB\u00b7AC > 0. Compute AB\u00b7AC = h(h\u22123), so we must have h > 3. Thus\nh = 3 + 2\u221a2.\n\nTherefore AD = h = 3 + 2\u221a2. \n\n\\boxed{3+2\\sqrt{2}}",

The chain is finite and irreducible, so it has a unique stationary distribution \u03c0. Because the transition rule is translation-invariant (the same from every lily pad), the stationary distribution must be uniform: \u03c0_j = 1/12 for all j. (Indeed \u03c0_j = (1/3)(\u03c0_{j-4}+\u03c0_{j-2}+\u03c0_{j+1}) is satisfied by \u03c0_j \u2261 1/12.)\n\nStep 3. For a positive-recurrent Markov chain, the expected return time to state 1 (first return, excluding time 0) equals 1/\u03c0_1 = 12.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{12}",
