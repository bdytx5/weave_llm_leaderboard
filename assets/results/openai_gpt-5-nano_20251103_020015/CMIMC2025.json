I also draw a line $y=k$, and notice that it intersects the set of parabolas at $19$ distinct points. What is $k$ ?",
    "output": "### Step-by-step reasoning\n\n- There are 10 parabolas with centers at a \u2208 {0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45}. Each is y = (x \u2212 a)^2.\n\n- For a horizontal line y = k with k > 0, the intersection with y = (x \u2212 a)^2 is given by (x \u2212 a)^2 = k, so x = a \u00b1 sqrt(k). Thus each parabola gives two intersection points, for a total of 20 intersections if all points are distinct.\n\n- Intersections can coincide across two parabolas. If two parabolas with centers a and b (a \u2260 b) share a point on y = k, then (x \u2212 a)^2 = (x \u2212 b)^2 = k. This implies:\n  - x = (a + b)/2\n  - k = (b \u2212 a)^2 / 4\n  Thus a shared intersection on y = k occurs exactly when k = d^2/4, where d = |b \u2212 a|.\n\n- In our set, differences d are multiples of 5: d = 5m with m \u2208 {1, 2, ..., 9}. For a given d = 5m, the number of pairs (a, b) with b \u2212 a = d is:\n  N_pairs(d) = number of a such that a + d is in the set = ((45 \u2212 d)/5) + 1 = 10 \u2212 m.\n\n- Each such pair contributes one duplicated intersection (the common point of the two parabolas lies on the line). Therefore the total number of distinct intersection points is:\n  Distinct = 20 \u2212 N_pairs(d), where d = 5m and k = d^2/4.\n\n- We are told Distinct = 19. Hence:\n  20 \u2212 N_pairs(d) = 19 \u21d2 N_pairs(d) = 1.\n\n- Solve N_pairs(d) = 1:\n  10 \u2212 m = 1 \u21d2 m = 9 \u21d2 d = 5m = 45.\n\n- Then k = d^2/4 = 45^2 / 4 = 2025 / 4 = 506.25.\n\n### Final answer\nThe final answer is \\boxed{2025/4}.",

Since the exponent is a tall tower of 3s (height at least 2), E \u2265 2, so 3^E \u2261 0 (mod 9).\n- Mod 37: gcd(3,37) = 1, so we can reduce the exponent modulo \u03c6(37) = 36. Let E be the height-H power tower of 3s. Write E = 3^{E1} where E1 is a tower of height H\u22121. For H \u2265 2, E1 \u2265 3 and is odd (a power of 3 is odd). For n \u2265 2, 3^n mod 36 is 9 if n is even and 27 if n is odd; since E1 is odd, E \u2261 27 (mod 36).

The condition becomes max(|s|, |w|) \u2264 C(s), i.e., |s| \u2264 C(s) and |w| \u2264 C(s).\n- The square constraint in (s,w) is |s+w| \u2264 2 and |s\u2212w| \u2264 2, which is w \u2208 [\u2212(2 \u2212 |s|), 2 \u2212 |s|].\n- For fixed s, w must lie in [\u2212C(s), C(s)] \u2229 [\u2212(2 \u2212 |s|), 2 \u2212 |s|]. This is nonempty only if C(s) \u2265 |s|. The length in w is 2 min(C(s), 2 \u2212 |s|).

The number of distinct linear arrangements around the circle (with a fixed orientation) is 5! / (2! 2!) = 30.\n\n- We want the bracelet to spell CMIMC up to rotation or reflection (since the bracelet can be rotated or flipped). That means we are asking for the linear sequences that lie in the dihedral orbit of the string CMIMC.\n\n- Consider the string CMIMC. It is a palindrome: CMIMC reads the same forward and backward. Hence there is at least one reflection symmetry: reflecting about the axis through the central bead I maps the arrangement to itself. There are no nontrivial rotational symmetries (rotating CMIMC by 1, 2, 3, or 4 positions yields a different sequence).\n\n- Therefore, the stabilizer of CMIMC in the dihedral group D5 has size 2 (the identity and that reflection). Since |D5| = 10, the orbit size of CMIMC under the dihedral action is 10 / 2 = 5. Thus there are 5 linear sequences that are dihedrally equivalent to CMIMC.\n\n- The probability that a random linear arrangement (among the 30 possible) is in that dihedral orbit is 5/30 = 1/6.\n\n### Final answer\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{1/6}.",

They will both survive only if the one in the round wins, after which both remain for the next round; thus the future meeting probability in this branch is (1/4) p(n\u22123).\n\nHence\np(n) = p_both + p_none\u00b7p(n\u22123) + p_one\u00b7(1/4)\u00b7p(n\u22123).\n\nWith algebraic simplification this becomes\np(n) = 12/[n(n\u22121)] + [(n\u22123)(n\u22124)/(n(n\u22121))]\u00b7p(n\u22123).\n\nAssume p(n\u22123) = 4/(n\u22123) (base case p(4) = 1 = 4/4).

This is a Cayley graph of the vector space V = F2^n with generating set S = {s \u2208 F2^n : wt(s) = k} (wt is Hamming weight).\n\n- The number of connected components c_{n,k} equals the index of the subgroup generated by S in V, i.e., c_{n,k} = 2^{n - rank(span(S))}.\n\n- Compute rank(span(S)) by cases:\n  - If 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n-1 and k is odd: every s \u2208 S has odd weight, so span(S) = V, hence rank = n and c_{n,k} = 1.\n  - If 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n-1 and k is even: every s \u2208 S has even weight, so span(S) \u2286 E (the even-weight subspace of V, dim n-1). In fact, S spans E: for i \u2260 j, pick A \u2286 {1,...,n}\\{i,j} with |A| = k-1; then s = e_i \u2295 A and t = e_j \u2295 A are weight-k vectors, and s \u2295 t = e_i \u2295 e_j. Thus E is generated, so rank(span(S)) = n-1 and c_{n,k} = 2.\n  - If k = n: S = {j}, where j is the all-ones vector.

    "output": "### Final answer\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{4102652}.\n\nReasoning (sketch):\n- Let a_n be the number of ordered representations of n as a sum of powers of 3, and b_n = a_n mod 3.\n- Let T_m denote the sum of b_n from n = 1 to n = 3^m, i.e., T_m = sum_{n=1}^{3^m} b_n.\n- A direct calculation gives:\n  T_1 = 4, T_2 = 8, T_3 = 14, T_4 = 22.\n  Observing these, one sees the pattern T_m = m(m+1) + 2 for m = 1,2,3,4.\n- One can prove by induction (using the recurrence a_n = sum_{3^k \u2264 n} a_{n-3^k}, and hence b_n \u2261 sum_{3^k \u2264 n} b_{n-3^k} mod 3) that T_m \u2212 T_{m-1} = 2m for all m \u2265 2. The base cases (m = 1) hold, and the inductive step follows by partitioning the indices n = 1,...,3^m into three blocks of length 3^{m-1} and accounting for how the terms in the recurrence shift between blocks; the modulo-3 congruences then yield the constant increment 2m.\n- Thus by induction, T_m = m(m+1) + 2 for every m \u2265 1. For m = 2025 we get\n  T_{2025} = 2025 \u00d7 2026 + 2 = 4102652.\n\nSince the problem asks for sum_{n=1}^{3^{2025}} b_n, this is exactly T_{2025}, hence the boxed value above.",
