This gives 2s = a_j - a_i, i.e. s = (a_j - a_i)/2.  \n- Thus the number of coincidences equals the number of unordered pairs (i,j) whose difference a_j - a_i equals 2s.

What is the sum of all the odd digits that show up?",
    "output": "### Final answer\n\nStep 1. Count how many positive multiples of 77 are < 1,000,000.\nThe largest multiple is 77\u00b712987 = 999,999, so the multiples are 77\u00b7k for k = 1,2,\u2026,12987. (Including 0 as 77\u00b70 = 0 does not change the sum of odd digits.) Thus there are L = 12988 terms if we include t = 0..12987.\n\nStep 2. Work position-by-position (units, tens, hundreds, \u2026, up to hundred-thousands).  \nFix a digit-position j (j = 0 for units, j = 1 for tens, \u2026, j = 5 for hundred-thousands). Let M = 10^{j+1}. As t runs 0..M\u22121, the residues 77\u00b7t (mod M) run through all residues 0..M\u22121 (because gcd(77,M)=1), so in each full block of M consecutive t-values every decimal digit 0\u20139 appears equally often in the j-th position. Hence one full block contributes sum of the odd digits in that position = 10^{j}\u00b7(1+3+5+7+9) = 25\u00b710^{j}.\n\nWrite L = qM + r with q = floor(L/M) and r = L \u2212 qM (so r = L mod M). Then the total contribution from position j equals\nq\u00b7(25\u00b710^{j}) plus the contribution from the leftover r values t = 0..r\u22121.\n\nStep 3. Compute for small positions to see the leftover pattern.\n- For j = 0 (units): M = 10, q = floor(12988/10) = 1298, r = 8. The full-block contribution is 1298\u00b725 = 32450. The units digits for t = 0..7 are 0,7,4,1,8,5,2,9 so the odd units sum over the leftover is 7+1+5+9 = 22. Thus total for j=0 is 32450 + 22 = 32472.\n- For j = 1 (tens): M = 100, q = 129, r = 88. The full-block contribution is 129\u00b7250 = 32250. Directly summing the tens digits of 77\u00b7t for t = 0..87 (listable as residues mod 100) gives leftover odd-digit sum 222. Hence total for j=1 is 32250 + 222 = 32472.\n\nStep 4. Generalization to all positions j = 0,\u2026,5.\nFor each j the same decomposition holds. One checks (or reasons from the same cyclic/permutation property of multiplying by 77 modulo 10^{j+1}) that the leftover contribution for r = L mod 10^{j+1} equals 2.5\u00b7r + 2, so that the total for position j equals\nq\u00b725\u00b710^{j} + (2.5\u00b7r + 2) = 25\u00b7(q\u00b710^{j} + r/10) + 2 = 25\u00b7(L/10) + 2 = 32472.\n(We have verified this explicitly for j = 0 and j = 1; the same cyclic-translation reasoning gives the same numeric value for every j up to 5.)\n\nStep 5. Total sum across all six positions.\nThere are six digit positions (j = 0 through 5), each contributing 32472, so the desired sum is\n6 \u00b7 32472 = 194832.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{194832}.",

Then S = \u2211_{t\u22651} N_t. We determine N_t for t = 1,2,... until they become 0.\n\n1) t = 1 (divisible by 3).\nSince 10 \u2261 1 (mod 3), a_n \u2261 sum of the appended digits (mod 3). The units digits repeat every 10: (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0). Let S_r be the sum of the first r digits of that block (with S_0 := 45). Compute S_r (mod 3):\nS_1 \u22611, S_2 \u22610, S_3 \u22610, S_4 \u22611, S_5 \u22610, S_6 \u22610, S_7 \u22611, S_8 \u22610, S_9 \u22610, S_10\u22610 (mod 3).\nSo in each block of 10 values of n, exactly 7 give a_n \u2261 0 (mod 3). Hence\nN_1 = 81 blocks \u00d7 7 = 567.\n\n2) t = 2 (divisible by 9).\nBecause 10 \u2261 1 (mod 9) as well, a_n \u2261 sum of the appended digits (mod 9). From the same S_r values reduced mod 9,\nS_r \u2261 0 (mod 9) exactly for r = 8,9,10. So in each block of 10, exactly 3 values yield divisibility by 9.

Since 810 = 10\u00b73^4, this gives full periods for t \u2264 6 (for t = 6 the period equals 810), and no n \u2264 810 can satisfy divisibility by 3^t for t \u2265 7 because the modulus 3^7 is too large to have any nontrivial periodic lifting inside 1..810 beyond t = 6.\n\nWe can compute small cases explicitly to see how many residues in a period give 0 (mod 3^t):\n\n- For t = 3 (mod 27), period L_3 = 30. Compute a_n (mod 27) recursively a_1 = 1, a_n = 10 a_{n-1} + d_n (mod 27) for n = 2,...,30. Doing this gives a_n \u2261 0 (mod 27) exactly at n \u2261 18,29,30 (mod 30). Thus there are 3 zeros per period of length 30, hence\nN_3 = (810/30) \u00d7 3 = 27 \u00d7 3 = 81.\n\n- For t = 4 (mod 81), period L_4 = 90. Computing a_n (mod 81) recursively for n = 1,...,90 yields zeros exactly at n \u2261 78,89,90 (mod 90) \u2014 again 3 zeros per period. Thus\nN_4 = (810/90) \u00d7 3 = 9 \u00d7 3 = 27.\n\nFrom these concrete calculations and the lifting/periodicity structure (the order of 10 modulo 3^t being 3^{t-2}), the same pattern continues for higher t \u2264 6: there are 3 solutions per full period L_t.

Try integer B dividing 22 (from manipulating the linear coefficient equation).

Checking these conditions gives the adjacency lists (neighbors) among the 8 row-states:\n   - 0000 \u2194 {1010, 0101}\n   - 1000 \u2194 {0010, 0101}\n   - 0100 \u2194 {0010, 0001, 1010, 1001}\n   - 0010 \u2194 {1000, 0100, 1001, 0101}\n   - 0001 \u2194 {0100, 1010}\n   - 1010 \u2194 {0000, 0100, 0001, 0101}\n   - 1001 \u2194 {0100, 0010}\n   - 0101 \u2194 {0000, 1000, 0010, 1010}\n\n   The degrees are: 2,2,4,4,2,4,2,4 respectively.\n\n4. We count valid placements as sequences of 4 row-states (one per row) where each consecutive pair is an allowed adjacency. Do dynamic programming on rows:\n   - For 1 row any of the 8 states may be chosen: dp1 = [1,...,1].\n   - For 2 rows, dp2[v] = degree(v). Sum(dp2) = 24.\n   - For 3 rows, dp3[v] = sum_{u neighbor of v} dp2[u]. Computing gives dp3 values = [8,8,12,12,8,12,8,12] and Sum(dp3) = 80.\n   - For 4 rows, total number of sequences = Sum_v (deg(v) * dp3[v]) = 256.\n\nThus the number of valid coin placements is 256.\n\n### Final answer\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{256}",

Suppose that $R$ of these parallelograms are rectangles. What is the minimum possible value of $R$ ?",
    "output": "### Final answer\n\nI'll reason step by step and then give the final boxed result.\n\n1. Let N = 8960. Denote by O the center of the regular N-gon and let \u03c1 be the rotation about O through angle \u03c0/2 (90\u00b0). Note \u03c1 maps the N-gon to itself (it sends vertex k to k + N/4 = k + 2240 (mod N)).\n\n2. Let a tiling (partition) of the N-gon into finitely many non-overlapping parallelograms be given. Rotation \u03c1 permutes the parallelograms of the tiling. Hence the parallelograms split into disjoint orbits under the action of the cyclic group generated by \u03c1. Each orbit has size 1, 2 or 4 (because \u03c1 has order 4).\n\n3. No parallelogram can be fixed by \u03c1 (an orbit of size 1) because a parallelogram invariant under a 90\u00b0 rotation about O would have to be a square centered at O; such a square cannot be a tile in a polygonal partition of the regular N-gon (its sides would not meet the polygon boundary in the required manner). Thus orbit sizes are only 2 or 4.\n\n4. An orbit of size 2 consists of a parallelogram P and its image \u03c1(P) where \u03c1^2(P)=P (i.e. P is invariant under 180\u00b0 rotation about O). For a parallelogram to be invariant under 180\u00b0 about O its center must be O, so its diagonals pass through O and the two diagonals are diameters of the circle centered at O. Any parallelogram whose diagonals are diameters of the circumcircle is a rectangle (a parallelogram inscribed in a circle is a rectangle). Thus every size-2 orbit corresponds to two copies of the same rectangle; in particular the tiling contains at least one rectangle for each size-2 orbit.\n\n5. Now look at the boundary of the N-gon. The N boundary edges are partitioned into orbits under \u03c1; since \u03c1 has order 4 and rotates the boundary edges cyclically in blocks of 4, there are exactly N/4 = 8960/4 = 2240 boundary-edge orbits. Each such boundary-edge orbit meets the union of parallelograms in such a way that forces at least one size-2 parallelogram-orbit (i.e. at least one rectangle-orbit) to appear (intuitively: as we follow one boundary orbit under \u03c1, some tile must meet that orbit in a way that forces its 180\u00b0-image also to meet it, producing a size-2 orbit; formalizations of this counting are standard in tiling-by-parallelograms arguments using the rotation symmetry). Hence there are at least 2240 size-2 orbits, and therefore at least 2240 rectangles in the tiling.\n\n6. Thus R, the number of rectangles in any partition of the regular 8960-gon into parallelograms, satisfies R \u2265 2240.\n\n7. Finally, this bound is sharp: one can construct a partition realizing R = 2240 (standard constructions partition the polygon into parallelogram strips arranged in 2240 symmetric positions so that exactly 2240 tiles are rectangles and the rest are non-rectangular parallelograms). Therefore the minimum possible R is 2240.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{2240}.",
