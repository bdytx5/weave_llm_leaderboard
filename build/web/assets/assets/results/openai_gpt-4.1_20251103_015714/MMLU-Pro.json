The context is most likely \"down sizing\" (not \"up sizing\") because it deals with **redundancy** and **being laid off**.\n2. The first blank after \"key issue\" relates to communication/information \u2014 employees' right to know about redundancy. \"Involvement\" (option J) fits here, as involvement refers to being included or informed in the process.\n3. The second issue is about \"package employees receive when laid off\" \u2014 that is, compensation or remuneration.\n4. The last blank should be something like \"compensation\" (usually called a \"compensation package\" when laid off).\n\n**Options with \"Down\" (relating to downsizing):**\n- A.

Because $50-$60 on a $12 stock is nonsensical for a call.\n\nAlso, is **annual volatility 20%** actually 20/USD per year? Unlikely.\n\nBut, let's be systematic.\n\nFor a European call option on a non-dividend stock, the **binomial model typically gives a small value for out-of-the-money options** (here $S_0 = 12$, $K = 14$).\n\nLet's try Black-Scholes for comparison:\n\n### **Black-Scholes:**\n\n\\[\nd_1 = \\frac{\\ln(S/K) + (r + 0.5 \\sigma^2) T}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}}\n\\]\n\\[\nd_1 = \\frac{\\ln(12/14) + (0.10 + 0.5 \\times 0.20^2) \\times 0.8333}{0.20 \\sqrt{0.8333}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\ln(12/14) = -0.15415\n\\]\n\\[\n(0.10 + 0.5 \\times 0.04) = 0.12\n\\]\n\\[\n0.12 \\times 0.8333 = 0.1\n\\]\n\\[\nNumerator = -0.15415 + 0.1 = -0.05415\n\\]\n\\[\nDenominator = 0.20 \\times 0.9129 = 0.18258\n\\]\n\\[\nd_1 = -0.05415 / 0.18258 = -0.2967\n\\]\n\\[\nd_2 = d_1 - 0.20 \\times 0.9129 = -0.2967 - 0.18258 = -0.4793\n\\]\n\\[\nN(d_1) \\approx 0.3859\n\\]\n\\[\nN(d_2) \\approx 0.3155\n\\]\n\\[\nC = S_0 N(d_1) - K e^{-r T} N(d_2)\n\\]\n\\[\nK e^{-r T} = 14 \\times e^{-0.10 \\times 0.8333} = 14 \\times 0.9200 = 12.88\n\\]\n\\[\nC = 12 \\times 0.3859 - 12.88 \\times 0.3155\n= 4.63 - 4.06 = 0.57\n\\]\n\nAgain, option price is less than $1.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nUnless there is a data error in the question (i.e., the current stock price is much higher, perhaps $120 or $140), **the correct price must be much less than any of the options provided.**\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\nGiven the data, the binomial and Black-Scholes calculation both return the option price around $0.20\u20130.57.  \n**None of the provided answers is correct.**\n\n**If you wish to check calculations with $S_0 = 120$, the price would be much higher and match those options.**  \nBut *with $S_0 = 12$ as stated*, **the price is about $0.20\u20130.60**.\n\n---\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is NOT among the provided options.**\n\nIf this is a typo and the stock price is $120, the option would be \"deep in the money,\" with an intrinsic value of $120 - $14 = $106; then you might have to select the closest from the provided options. But with $12, none matches.  \n**If you need the price for $S_0 = 120$, let me know and I'll recalculate.**",
